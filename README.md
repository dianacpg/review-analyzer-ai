Database was created using [PlanetScale](https://planetscale.com/docs/prisma/prisma-quickstart), MySQL-compatible serverless database, that has a great developer experience. To do that, create an account, a database, install [planetscale CLI](https://github.com/planetscale/cli#installation) and connect by running:

```
pscale auth login

pscale connect <YOUR_DATABASE_NAME> <YOUR_BRANCH> â€” port 3309
```

,

Connect db with prisma by adding secret in .env as in [planetscale documentation](https://planetscale.com/docs/prisma/prisma-quickstart)

```
DATABASE_URL = 'mysql://root@127.0.0.1:3309/<YOUR_DATABASE_NAME>'
```

Run server

```bash
npm run dev
```
